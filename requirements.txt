# OpenAI → Mistral Migration Tool
#
# This tool uses only Python standard library to ensure maximum portability.
# No external dependencies required for CLI usage!
#
# For Web UI:
flask>=2.3.0

# To run the examples, you'll need the respective SDKs:
#
# For OpenAI examples:
# openai>=1.0.0
#
# For Mistral examples:
# mistralai>=0.1.0
#
# The CLI migration tool itself requires NO dependencies.
# This is intentional - good DX means minimal setup friction.
